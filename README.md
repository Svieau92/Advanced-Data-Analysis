# Advanced-Data-Analysis

This is where I will keep my qmarkdown files for the Advanced Data Analysis Class.

This will serve three functions:

1) Create a backup where I can store my code and projects

2) Allow me to practice using git

3) Set up the backbone for me to eventually host all of these analyses on a single website, which will be my CV.
