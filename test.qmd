# Introduction

The aim of the current study is to assess how treatment response differs for HIV+ patients 2 years after initiating Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) based on hard drug usage (such as heroin or cocaine). This study is of particular scientific interest because it is unclear whether the use of hard drugs inhibits the immune system in humans; treatment strategies may differ based on these results. The researchers are interested in comparing subjects who never used hard drugs to current hard drug users (those that use hard drugs at year 2) or previous hard drug users (those who used drugs at year 0 or 1). Outcomes of interest are: viral load (HIV copies in a mL of blood), CD4+ T cell count (a measure of immunologic health), and aggregate physical and quality of life scores from the SF-36.

The clinical hypothesis is that, if hard drugs inhibit the immune system in humans, subjects who currently or previously used hard drugs will have higher viral load and lower CD4+ T cell counts than those who never used hard drugs. Additionally, the researchers are interested in knowing if potential differences between the drug use groups can be explained by differences in adherence to the treatment regimen. The researchers are agnostic on how quality of life changes after treatment, since side effects of the treatment are significant.

# Method

**Study Design**

This is a secondary data analysis of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study investigating the natural and treated disease progression of HIV-1 in bisexual men in 4 major cities in the U.S. Measurements for all variables were taken once per year over an 8-year time period; however, the current analysis is only concerned with treatment outcomes after 2 years of HAART. Data was received as a longform .csv file containing 33 columns along with a data dictionary. The main outcomes of interest are viral load, CD4+ T cell count, and aggregate physical and quality of life scores. Adherence to treatment regiment will be investigated as a potential confounder.

Potential covariates of interest include: marijuana usage since last visit and frequency of usage, income, BMI, high blood pressure, diabetes, liver disease stage 3 / 4, kidney disease, frailty related phenotype, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting LDL, dyslipidemia, depression score, smoking status, alcohol use since last visit, heroin or opiate use since last visit, intravenous drug use since last visit, race, education at baseline, age, if they took ART at the visit or if they have ever taken it before, and years since initiating ART.

## Data Preparation

First we load the necessary packages

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(naniar)
library(kableExtra)
library(table1)
```

Then we import the data set.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/sviea/Documents/Portfolio/Project_2/Project_2_R/RawData/hiv_dataset.csv")
```

And take a look.

```{r}
glimpse(data)
```

Everything appears properly formatted,
